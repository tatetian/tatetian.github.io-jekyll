title: Why Should I (or Any Tech Talent) Start Blogging?
---


The decision to start blogging is not an easy one for me.

Indeed, I always enjoy reading technical blogs. And some of the authors that I
really admire have written excellent posts on the benefits of blogging. Yet,  a
personal blog demands a great effort— gather materials, forge ideas, structure
content, make an argument, not to mention the difficulty of writing in English
as a second language  — all of which are really intimidating to me. But somehow
I know that this is the right thing for me to do. So in this very first post, I
shall talk myself, and hopefully you (if you are a geek) as well,  into
blogging.

## A permanent exhibition of one's works

A personal technical website is like a permanent exhibition of one's works.

Talking about exhibition, no one is more good at it than artists. I have quite
a few good friends who study arts. One thing that I admire the art people for
is they have a good tradition of exhibition. Artists and designers are trained
in an environment that encourages, rewards or even demands them to present
their works to other artists or the public. Surely, the art community must have
realized, for ages, the positive effects of exhibition: it can be a motivator
to improve work to perfection, an opportunity to get constructive feedbacks, or
even better an achievement that makes you feel that every bit of your effort
eventually pays off.

Unfortunately, our computer science education is way behind in this aspect, at
least in the top computer science department of the most prestigious university
in China. We are well trained on solving problems on our own, but not sharing
results with others. Very few of us bother to share our knowledge and insights
publicly, like writing a technical blog. Maybe it’s the common pitfall of
engineering educations. Maybe it’s the shyness of Chinese people. Whatever the
reasons, most of us are just too lazy, too shy or too stupid, to show the best
of our expertise.

We are living in an era that values technology talents who has an artistic
mindset. Technology and art. Steve Jobs married one to the other. *[Hackers and
Painters](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449389554/)*. Paul Graham made himself both.
Every serious designer have his/her own portfolio website. So should a geek.

## Expressing myself: the desire and fear

> “I want freedom for the full expression of my personality.” ― Mahatma Gandhi

The innate desire of expressing oneself is within everyone. I am no exception.

Blogging can be an ideal way to express personal opinions. I know that I am
talented and well-educated, having valuable experience and novel insights that
can be shared with the world. And somehow I have already convinced myself that
blogging is a decision that I would never regret. Yet still I am  reluctant to
blog. I fear of expressing myself—

For the curse of perfectionist.

When I was younger, I often claimed myself as a perfectionist,
*proudly*. To me, perfectionism used to be equivalent to striving for
excellence. Now that I am more mature, I know that perfectionism can be
detrimental: overly high standards, harsh self-criticism, and excessive concerns
regarding others’ evaluation. It is this dark side of my personality that is
bombarding my mind with doubts: "Is your English writing good enough? Can your
posts make any difference to the readers? What if you blunder and make a fool
of yourself?”

“But, so what?” the other half of me responds, “Yes, I am likely to suck at first, but
over time I will get better, *definitely*. ”

Blogging is a fullfillment to the need of expressing myself, and maybe more
importantly, a treatment to my perfectionism.

## Final thoughts

This post is mainly about my rationale of blogging, which, given the fact that
everyone has different characteristics and needs, may not be adequate to you.
